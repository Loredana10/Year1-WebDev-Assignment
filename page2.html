                <div id = "title"><h2>Greece</h2></div>
                <p>The country of Greece is considered a Mediterranean gem. And, rightly so because when you visit Greece, you will feel you are in paradise. Or so I've been told. Greece is a beautiful amalgamation of historic ruins, pristine beaches, stunning landscapes, and some delicious food.<br><br> Every corner, every city has a beautiful story that is waiting to be told. Visiting Greece is probably one of the top things on my to-do list, and heres why.</p>

                <div id="title"><h2>Japan</h2></div>

                <div id = "visual"><img src = "Images\japan.jpg" alt = "Japan"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rcnLTnGGBU0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
                <p> Japan is one of the most amazing tourist destinations in my opinion. and it offers many unique experiences that you cannot find in any other part of the world.<br><br> It is one of the oldest civilizations and has a beautiful and diverse history. The stunning, diverse scenery with mountains and breathtaking views, offers so many different experiences that attract tourists from all corners of the world.</p>

                <br><br><br><br><br><br>
                <div id = "subtitle"><h4>Northern Lights</h4></div>
                <p>Iceland's location on the top of the world also ensures that it is among the best places to see the northern lights or aurora borealis.<br><br> These spectacular celestial wonders are commonly seen in Iceland from September to mid-April and are among the top reasons to visit Iceland outside of the bright summer months. </p>

                <div id = "subtitle"><h4>Beaches and islands</h4></div>
                <p> Greece is home to many stunning beaches and islands.<br><br> Each island being different from the other, the islands of Greece are absolutely breathtaking. They also have a number of activities that you can opt for like diving, surfing, renting boats/yachts to elevate your experience.<br> Many famous movies like Mama Mia and Dancing Queen have also been shot in these surreal islands.</p>
                <br><br><br><br><br><br>

                <div id = "subtitle"><h4>Nature</h4></div>
                <p>The first thing is obviously the natural beauty of the country. As soon as you travel outside of the big and modern cities you will discover that the country is home to some of the best natural scenery in the world.<br>From the wilderness in Hokkaido to the white pristine beaches of Okinawa, Japan's nature is incredibly diverse. <br>The rugged mountains, rocky coastlines, pristine white beaches, bamboo forests and some of the world's most beautiful waterfalls are just some of the natural beauty to be enjoyed all year round.<br>Mount Fuji is famous all over the world as a place to visit during any season of the year. Japanese people have always held Mount Fuji close to their heart and Mount Fuji is displayed in many artistic outings, including (ancient) pottery, calligraphy, ukiyo-e paintings and woodblock prints.<br>Climbing Mount Fuji is at the top of my bucket list and an estimated 400,000 people climb the volcano each year.</p>

                <div id="title"><h2>Iceland</h2></div>
                <p>Iceland is the most peaceful country in the world.</p><p>There's no question why everyone is travelling to Iceland these days â€” the country has long been known for its stunning landscapes, northern lights and history. Beyond the scenery, however, there are many other things that are interesting about Iceland and Icelanders.</p>
