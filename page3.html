                <p>This might be a biased opinion, since I am from Romania, but without a doubt anyone would agree with me that Romania is a beautiful country to visit. </p>

                <div id = "subtitle"><h4>Marseille</h4></div>

                
                <p>My favourite province in France is Marseille and here is why. Some of the many reasons to visit include, the long coastline for beach-going and boating, the temperate climate, the abundant sun, the diversity (of people, of architecture, of activities), and the southern, laid-back pace. <br><br>I love Marseille because it is unlike any other city in France or the world for that matter, and at 2600 years old, there is no shortage of things to discover. You get the best of the city and beach in one place. <br><br> For a casual lunch with friends, I highly recommend the Épicerie l'Idéal (11 Rue d'Aubagne), a grocery store/café/deli run by a food writer and the friendliest staff. It was my favourite place to have a cup of coffee and a delicious pastry. </p>

                <p>One of Switzerland's biggest draws is its gorgeous landscapes. From the towering peaks of  Jungfraujoch—known as “The Top of Europe”<br>—to the panoramic passes of Great St. Bernard and Furka, this country offers experiences and memories that will stick with you foever. </p>

                <div id = "subtitle"><h4>Transylvania</h4></div>
                <p> Dracula's castle, found in Brasov Transylvania, is undoubtedly the coolest, and most inteeresting tourist attraction in Romania. <br><br> Transylvania is known for its stunning castles such as Bran and Corvin.
                Bran castle, near Brasov, is a Gothic fairy-tale structure, often associated with  Prince Vlad Tepes, the inspiration for Bram Stoker's novel Dracula.<br><br>
                The 15th-century Corvin Castle, with its towers and buttresses reminiscent of the medieval times, is considered by many the most beautiful in Transylvania.<br><br>Transylavania gets the most tourists in winter, since the snowy scenery is perfect for aesthetic photography.</p>

                <div id = "visual"><img src = "Images\france1.jpg" alt = "France"></div>
                <p> It almost goes without saying, but France is a huge draw for foreign visitors, over 30 million of them a year in just the capital city alone, more than any other city in the world.<br><br>The appel of France for tourists is the city's romantic image, the stunning architecture, the Louvre museum, the iconic Eiffel Tower and many more.<br><br>Personally, what I loved the most about Paris when I went there was the cafés, pastries and the amazing food. </p>

                <div id = "subtitle"><h4>Zermatt</h4></div> 
                <p>Zermatt is the most famous ski resort in Switzerland, and I got to travel to these beautiful mountains a few years ago. <br>Zermatt is perfect for ski enthusiast and winter sports lovers.<br><br>The world's highest 3S cableway, the Matterhorn Glacier Ride, carries 2,000 skiers an hour to the Matterhorn Glacier, at 3,883 meters altitude, where you can ski year-round.<br><br> A free Zermatt Skiguide app uses GPS to help skiers navigate between mountain locations, with time and routes adjusted to the user's skiing style, safety concerns, weather, and the currently open lifts and pistes.<br><br> As well as snow sports, people can enjoy mouth-watering local foods, and the area is full of culture and history.</p>
